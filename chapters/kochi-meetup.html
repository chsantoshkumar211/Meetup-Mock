                                The talk covered how the STUXNET worm infects computers and how it spreads across the network of computers.Once inside a network, it uses a variety of mechanisms to propagate to other machines within that network and gain system privileges once it has infected those machines.These mechanisms include both known, patched vulnerabilities and four "zero-day exploits".The speaker left the audience inspired, explained to them how important it is to learn cybersecurity and extend their support in protecting the nation from these kinds of cyber attacks.
